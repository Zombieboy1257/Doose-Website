		<h1>Doose's Webpage</h1>
		<h2>A place to love Doose</h2>
		
		Doose has only been with me for a couple of months, but I have grown <b>extremely</b> fond of him.
		
		
		<p>
			While he is still pretty timid, his bravery to come and check out my hand whenever i dangle it in the cage brings me great joy. <s>I want to squish his big cheeks</s> I perhaps show him a little too much affection when he does so.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Here he is when I first got him. So much fluff to actual Doose ratio.
